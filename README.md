This repository has been created to sbmit my work on the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" at the end of the fourth week of the Coursera class.

##**Obtaining the files**
A full description of the data used can be seen on the [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The script needs the working directory to be set  where the data is extracted.

The markdown CodeBook.md describes differents steps (getting the data, transformations) used to finally get the tidy dat set.

The five main steps are:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
